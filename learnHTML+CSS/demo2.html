Yet they are also are among the most controversial.\r\nMention the Samwer name at an internet conference from LeWeb in\r\nParis to Munich's <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/14/dld-stats?page=all">DLD</a>, and there's a good chance you'll hear them dismissed as\r\n"clone" kings, who simply copy existing high-growth web companies,\r\nfrom <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-10/25/hotels-old-fashioned">Airbnb</a> to <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/22/pinterest-is-the-tidy-web">Pinterest</a> -- often selling the businesses back to the people\r\nwho originated the idea. It's a strategy that has made them plenty\r\nof enemies: "The Samwer brothers are despicable thieves," serial\r\nentrepreneur Jason Calacanis tweeted in December. "How do they\r\nsleep at night?"</p><p>Now the brothers are facing more than peer disapproval.\r\nDisaffected staff at their Rocket Internet incubator have been\r\nquitting. According to former senior manager Christian Weiss,\r\naround 25 people have so far given notice, including Weiss himself,\r\nto start their own incubator. Then, last December, Oliver Samwer\r\nwas forced to issue a public apology after an internal memo was\r\nleaked to TechCrunch: "I will die to win and I expect the same from\r\nyou," he told senior staff building an international furniture\r\nbusiness. "The time for the blitzkrieg must be chosen wisely, so\r\neach country tells me with blood when it is time. I am ready --\r\nanytime!\u2026 I do not accept surprises.

Oliver, 39, is trim and decked out in a fitted\r\nbutton-down shirt, jeans and Gucci sneakers.</p><p>Alexander, 37, is in the office too, wearing a blue Lacoste\r\nshirt. The youngest brother, he holds a master's degree from Oxford\r\nand a Harvard MBA. Marc, 41, who has a reputation for being the\r\nmost charismatic of the three, is currently busy with his duties at\r\nGroupon.</p><p>Alexander is cordial, but the job of talking on the record goes\r\nto Oliver. "We are builders of companies, we are not innovators,"\r\nhe tells Wired. "Someone else is the architect and we are the\r\nbuilders."</p><p>Oliver takes issue with the prevailing notion that he and his\r\nbrothers are driven purely by money. "If I was motivated by money\r\nalone, I would have stopped a long time ago," he insists. Rather,\r\nhe suggests that what galvanises them is winning: "To prove over\r\nand over again that we're the best," he explains.</p><p>In an industry that celebrates innovation, the Samwers are not\r\noriginators, but they are extremely effective in their chosen\r\nfield: they see concepts that are working in the US or Asia and\r\nreplicate the approach for new markets with high barriers of entry.\r\nTheir "clones" can be found in populous, non-English-speaking\r\ncountries including Germany, China, Russia and Brazil.</p><p>"It's become a joke: 'You'd better watch your back or the\r\nGermans will kill you,'" says San Francisco-based Lo\xefc Le Meur, who\r\nruns LeWeb. Le Meur says that he has no desire to trash the\r\nSamwers, whom he considers to be friends; but he does worry that\r\ntheir success has helped to encourage other copycats. "It's making\r\na lot of money for the Samwers, but it's killing innovation in\r\nEurope. It's telling young entrepreneurs that the ideal way to make\r\nmoney is by copying something that works in the US, then selling it\r\nback to the original."</p><p>***</p><p>Serial entrepreneur <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-insider/2011/fail-talk">Stefan\r\nGlaenzer</a> made a similar point in an op-ed for the Frankfurter\r\nAllgemeine in 2010. He speculated that Berlin's Mitte district had\r\nbecome the global centre for cloning digital businesses, and called\r\non investors and entrepreneurs to summon "the courage to think big\r\nand try to improve the world rather than chase the fast buck".</p><p>Shortly after he wrote this, two entrepreneurs who had\r\npreviously worked for the Samwers came to Glaenzer with the idea\r\nfor DailyDeal, a Groupon clone. "When [Fabian and Ferry Heilemann]\r\ntold me about Groupon's business model, I was amazed by its\r\nbeauty," he says. He softened his stance to invest.</p><p>"I said, even though I wrote a huge article two months before\r\nabout how much I hated copying, I would actually engage with the\r\ncopying," says Glaenzer. He cofounded Rebate Networks with StudiVZ\r\ncofounder Michael Brehm to export the model to eastern Europe,\r\nsouth-east Asia and China. "From a business point of view, it's the\r\nfastest-growing business ever," Glaenzer says. DailyDeal was\r\nacquired by <a href="/topics/google">Google</a> in September 2011\r\nfor a sum rumoured to be between \xa398 million and \xa3130 million.

In 1998, when the brothers were\r\nliving in San Francisco, Marc was struck by the number of people in\r\nhis office who were using eBay. Following a brainstorming session\r\nduring a Christmas holiday together, the Samwers agreed that eBay\r\nwould make sense in the German marketplace.</p><p>Europe's largest economy had been through a decade of fierce\r\nupheaval following its reunification in 1990, but retail law was\r\nstill focused on preserving social mores rather than promoting\r\ncommerce. Sunday-shopping laws were restrictive, and Germany\r\nboasted Europe's toughest restrictions on retail discounts. Online\r\nauctions would at last offer Germans the chance to feel they were\r\ngetting a deal. The brothers say they sent several emails to eBay\r\nsuggesting that the company establish an online auction platform in\r\nGermany, and that they should be hired to run it. When they didn't\r\nreceive a reply, the brothers returned to Germany and, in January\r\n1999, brought in three friends to develop their own platform.</p><p>A month later they founded Alando \xad-- a German-language online\r\nauction website. Among the first items for sale were their own\r\nchildhood toys: Alex sold his train set, Marc auctioned an old pair\r\nof roller skates and Oliver some coins. The team also created what\r\nit called "category captains" who were each responsible for a\r\nspecific area of the site. "We had one person focusing on stamp\r\ndealers, one person focusing on consumer electronics etc," Oliver\r\nsays. "We took it into our own hands and didn't wait for the market\r\nto be founded."</p><p>Within 100 days of going live, the site was sold to eBay for \xa335\r\nmillion. "Those three months were all about execution," says Niko\r\nWaesche, an entrepreneur who helped set up Alando's technology.\r\n"When it started, there were at least 18 auction sites in Germany\r\n-- we weren't the only ones. [The Samwers] were execution\r\nmotors."</p><p>On September 22, 1999, <em>The New York Times</em> ran a story\r\nabout the Samwer brothers and Alando, detailing how they had\r\ninspired other German startups. The success of the German eBay also\r\nalerted major US tech firms to the potency of the market in\r\nGermany. Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman recalled in her autobiography:\r\n"When we started eBay Germany, it took off like an absolute rocket\u2026\r\nGermany was the fastest growing of all eBay sites."</p><p>The Samwers remained at eBay for a year, before leaving to\r\ncreate Jamba!, a mobile-phone-content platform. The brothers again\r\ndemonstrated entrepreneurial flare: when revenues initially didn't\r\nmeet expectations, Oliver decided that rather than pushing\r\nindividual ringtones, the company would create a subscription\r\nmodel. The Samwers also did something else that was unusual for\r\nonline at the time -- they invested heavily in television\r\nadvertising. "Many people think that it doesn't pay back," Marc\r\nSamwer told the <a href="http://www.googlezeitgeist.com/en/">Google\r\nZeitgeist</a> conference in 2007. "We tested it, first with\r\n$10,000, then with $100,000, then with $1 million. In 2005, we\r\nspent $70 million in one quarter on television advertising\r\nworldwide."</p><p>The brothers also bankrolled the creation of a new character for\r\nthe mobile age: the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkHm8uUuT0o">Crazy Frog</a>.\r\nRegularly cited as one of the most annoying pop creations in\r\nhistory, the tune sped to number one on singles charts across\r\nEurope and beyond. Jamba! was sold to VeriSign, the\r\nnetwork-infrastructure company, for \xa3176 million in 2004. The sale\r\nwas proof of concept: the Samwers' pragmatic method, an approach\r\nbuilt on the inspiration and innovations of others, was now a\r\ncertifiable business model.</p><p>Over the next few years, the brothers invested in German\r\nversions of YouTube (MyVideo), Twitter (Frazr) and Facebook\r\n(StudiVZ), as well as other technology properties based on US\r\nmodels. Not all were successes, but there were enough to suggest\r\nthe Samwers could take their model one step further. In 2007, they\r\nfounded Rocket Internet, their Berlin-based incubator that's often\r\nderided as a clone factory. Oliver prefers to think of it as "the\r\nUnited Nations of entrepreneurs". On its website, Rocket states\r\nthat it supports companies in more than 20 countries. "Fail fast"\r\nmight be the entrepreneurs' mantra, but at Rocket the wisdom is\r\nslightly different: scale fast.</p>\n<div class="sharePanel"

Oliver, 39, is trim and decked out in a fitted\r\nbutton-down shirt, jeans and Gucci sneakers.</p><p>Alexander, 37, is in the office too, wearing a blue Lacoste\r\nshirt. The youngest brother, he holds a master's degree from Oxford\r\nand a Harvard MBA. Marc, 41, who has a reputation for being the\r\nmost charismatic of the three, is currently busy with his duties at\r\nGroupon.</p><p>Alexander is cordial, but the job of talking on the record goes\r\nto Oliver. "We are builders of companies, we are not innovators,"\r\nhe tells Wired. "Someone else is the architect and we are the\r\nbuilders."</p><p>Oliver takes issue with the prevailing notion that he and his\r\nbrothers are driven purely by money. "If I was motivated by money\r\nalone, I would have stopped a long time ago," he insists. Rather,\r\nhe suggests that what galvanises them is winning: "To prove over\r\nand over again that we're the best," he explains.</p><p>In an industry that celebrates innovation, the Samwers are not\r\noriginators, but they are extremely effective in their chosen\r\nfield: they see concepts that are working in the US or Asia and\r\nreplicate the approach for new markets with high barriers of entry.\r\nTheir "clones" can be found in populous, non-English-speaking\r\ncountries including Germany, China, Russia and Brazil.</p><p>"It's become a joke: 'You'd better watch your back or the\r\nGermans will kill you,'" says San Francisco-based Lo\xefc Le Meur, who\r\nruns LeWeb. Le Meur says that he has no desire to trash the\r\nSamwers, whom he considers to be friends; but he does worry that\r\ntheir success has helped to encourage other copycats. "It's making\r\na lot of money for the Samwers, but it's killing innovation in\r\nEurope. It's telling young entrepreneurs that the ideal way to make\r\nmoney is by copying something that works in the US, then selling it\r\nback to the original."</p><p>***</p><p>Serial entrepreneur <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-insider/2011/fail-talk">Stefan\r\nGlaenzer</a> made a similar point in an op-ed for the Frankfurter\r\nAllgemeine in 2010. He speculated that Berlin's Mitte district had\r\nbecome the global centre for cloning digital businesses, and called\r\non investors and entrepreneurs to summon "the courage to think big\r\nand try to improve the world rather than chase the fast buck".</p><p>Shortly after he wrote this, two entrepreneurs who had\r\npreviously worked for the Samwers came to Glaenzer with the idea\r\nfor DailyDeal, a Groupon clone. "When [Fabian and Ferry Heilemann]\r\ntold me about Groupon's business model, I was amazed by its\r\nbeauty," he says. He softened his stance to invest.</p><p>"I said, even though I wrote a huge article two months before\r\nabout how much I hated copying, I would actually engage with the\r\ncopying," says Glaenzer. He cofounded Rebate Networks with StudiVZ\r\ncofounder Michael Brehm to export the model to eastern Europe,\r\nsouth-east Asia and China. "From a business point of view, it's the\r\nfastest-growing business ever," Glaenzer says. DailyDeal was\r\nacquired by <a href="/topics/google">Google</a> in September 2011\r\nfor a sum rumoured to be between \xa398 million and \xa3130 million. It\r\nseems that even the doubters can be persuaded of the benefits of\r\ncloning.</p><div class="incontentAd cnGptAlign_HorizontalCentered cnGptNotFullWidthSlot cnGptSlotOuter" id="article-bottom_GptOuter"><div class="cnGptSlotInner" id="article-bottom"><script>GptAdSlots.register('article-bottom', '/5574/uk.n5574.wired/magazine', {"delaySlot":false,"deleteSlotIfEmpty":true,"sizes":"420x160,300x250,300x600,300x251","containerMinWidthToSizeMap":null,"viewportMinWidthToSizeMap":null,"beforeAdLoadingCallback":null,"onRenderEndedCallback":null,"onJumpinessMinimisedRenderEndedCallback":null,"onSizeChangedCallback":null,"keyValues":{"ismobile":["true"],"istablet":["false"],"pukwrd":["magazine/readmag"],"doctype":["Article"],"nodeid":["15807"],"tag_KeywordTags":["Magazine features","Samwer brothers","Marc","Oliver","Alexander","Samwer","Rocket Internet","Groupon","eBay","Airbnb","Pinterest","Stefan Glaenzer"],"position":["article-bottom"]},"minimiseJumpiness":false});</script></div></div><p>The model that proved so effective for the Samwers came about,\r\nif not by accident, at least partly as a result of eBay's\r\ninattentiveness in its early days. In 1998, when the brothers were\r\nliving in San Francisco, Marc was struck by the number of people in\r\nhis office who were using eBay. Following a brainstorming session\r\nduring a Christmas holiday together, the Samwers agreed that eBay\r\nwould make sense in the German marketplace.</p><p>Europe's largest economy had been through a decade of fierce\r\nupheaval following its reunification in 1990, but retail law was\r\nstill focused on preserving social mores rather than promoting\r\ncommerce. Sunday-shopping laws were restrictive, and Germany\r\nboasted Europe's toughest restrictions on retail discounts. Online\r\nauctions would at last offer Germans the chance to feel they were\r\ngetting a deal. The brothers say they sent several emails to eBay\r\nsuggesting that the company establish an online auction platform in\r\nGermany, and that they should be hired to run it. When they didn't\r\nreceive a reply, the brothers returned to Germany and, in January\r\n1999, brought in three friends to develop their own platform.</p><p>A month later they founded Alando \xad-- a German-language online\r\nauction website. Among the first items for sale were their own\r\nchildhood toys: Alex sold his train set, Marc auctioned an old pair\r\nof roller skates and Oliver some coins. The team also created what\r\nit called "category captains" who were each responsible for a\r\nspecific area of the site. "We had one person focusing on stamp\r\ndealers, one person focusing on consumer electronics etc," Oliver\r\nsays. "We took it into our own hands and didn't wait for the market\r\nto be founded."</p><p>Within 100 days of going live, the site was sold to eBay for \xa335\r\nmillion. "Those three months were all about execution," says Niko\r\nWaesche, an entrepreneur who helped set up Alando's technology.\r\n"When it started, there were at least 18 auction sites in Germany\r\n-- we weren't the only ones. [The Samwers] were execution\r\nmotors."</p><p>On September 22, 1999, <em>The New York Times</em> ran a story\r\nabout the Samwer brothers and Alando, detailing how they had\r\ninspired other German startups. The success of the German eBay also\r\nalerted major US tech firms to the potency of the market in\r\nGermany. Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman recalled in her autobiography:\r\n"When we started eBay Germany, it took off like an absolute rocket\u2026\r\nGermany was the fastest growing of all eBay sites."</p><p>The Samwers remained at eBay for a year, before leaving to\r\ncreate Jamba!, a mobile-phone-content platform. The brothers again\r\ndemonstrated entrepreneurial flare: when revenues initially didn't\r\nmeet expectations, Oliver decided that rather than pushing\r\nindividual ringtones, the company would create a subscription\r\nmodel. The Samwers also did something else that was unusual for\r\nonline at the time -- they invested heavily in television\r\nadvertising. "Many people think that it doesn't pay back," Marc\r\nSamwer told the <a href="http://www.googlezeitgeist.com/en/">Google\r\nZeitgeist</a> conference in 2007. "We tested it, first with\r\n$10,000, then with $100,000, then with $1 million. In 2005, we\r\nspent $70 million in one quarter on television advertising\r\nworldwide."</p><p>The brothers also bankrolled the creation of a new character for\r\nthe mobile age: the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkHm8uUuT0o">Crazy Frog</a>.\r\nRegularly cited as one of the most annoying pop creations in\r\nhistory, the tune sped to number one on singles charts across\r\nEurope and beyond. Jamba! was sold to VeriSign, the\r\nnetwork-infrastructure company, for \xa3176 million in 2004. The sale\r\nwas proof of concept: the Samwers' pragmatic method, an approach\r\nbuilt on the inspiration and innovations of others, was now a\r\ncertifiable business model.</p><p>Over the next few years, the brothers invested in German\r\nversions of YouTube (MyVideo), Twitter (Frazr) and Facebook\r\n(StudiVZ), as well as other technology properties based on US\r\nmodels. Not all were successes, but there were enough to suggest\r\nthe Samwers could take their model one step further. In 2007, they\r\nfounded Rocket Internet, their Berlin-based incubator that's often\r\nderided as a clone factory. Oliver prefers to think of it as "the\r\nUnited Nations of entrepreneurs". On its website, Rocket states\r\nthat it supports companies in more than 20 countries. "Fail fast"\r\nmight be the entrepreneurs' mantra, but at Rocket the wisdom is\r\nslightly different: scale fast.</p>\n<div class="sharePanel"

DailyDeal was\r\nacquired by <a href="/topics/google">Google</a> in September 2011\r\nfor a sum rumoured to be between \xa398 million and \xa3130 million.

In 1998, when the brothers were\r\nliving in San Francisco, Marc was struck by the number of people in\r\nhis office who were using eBay. Following a brainstorming session\r\nduring a Christmas holiday together, the Samwers agreed that eBay\r\nwould make sense in the German marketplace.</p><p>Europe's largest economy had been through a decade of fierce\r\nupheaval following its reunification in 1990, but retail law was\r\nstill focused on preserving social mores rather than promoting\r\ncommerce. Sunday-shopping laws were restrictive, and Germany\r\nboasted Europe's toughest restrictions on retail discounts. Online\r\nauctions would at last offer Germans the chance to feel they were\r\ngetting a deal. The brothers say they sent several emails to eBay\r\nsuggesting that the company establish an online auction platform in\r\nGermany, and that they should be hired to run it. When they didn't\r\nreceive a reply, the brothers returned to Germany and, in January\r\n1999, brought in three friends to develop their own platform.</p><p>A month later they founded Alando \xad-- a German-language online\r\nauction website. Among the first items for sale were their own\r\nchildhood toys: Alex sold his train set, Marc auctioned an old pair\r\nof roller skates and Oliver some coins. The team also created what\r\nit called "category captains" who were each responsible for a\r\nspecific area of the site. "We had one person focusing on stamp\r\ndealers, one person focusing on consumer electronics etc," Oliver\r\nsays. "We took it into our own hands and didn't wait for the market\r\nto be founded."</p><p>Within 100 days of going live, the site was sold to eBay for \xa335\r\nmillion. "Those three months were all about execution," says Niko\r\nWaesche, an entrepreneur who helped set up Alando's technology.\r\n"When it started, there were at least 18 auction sites in Germany\r\n-- we weren't the only ones. [The Samwers] were execution\r\nmotors."</p><p>On September 22, 1999, <em>The New York Times</em> ran a story\r\nabout the Samwer brothers and Alando, detailing how they had\r\ninspired other German startups. The success of the German eBay also\r\nalerted major US tech firms to the potency of the market in\r\nGermany. Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman recalled in her autobiography:\r\n"When we started eBay Germany, it took off like an absolute rocket\u2026\r\nGermany was the fastest growing of all eBay sites."</p><p>The Samwers remained at eBay for a year, before leaving to\r\ncreate Jamba!, a mobile-phone-content platform. The brothers again\r\ndemonstrated entrepreneurial flare: when revenues initially didn't\r\nmeet expectations, Oliver decided that rather than pushing\r\nindividual ringtones, the company would create a subscription\r\nmodel. The Samwers also did something else that was unusual for\r\nonline at the time -- they invested heavily in television\r\nadvertising. "Many people think that it doesn't pay back," Marc\r\nSamwer told the <a href="http://www.googlezeitgeist.com/en/">Google\r\nZeitgeist</a> conference in 2007. "We tested it, first with\r\n$10,000, then with $100,000, then with $1 million. In 2005, we\r\nspent $70 million in one quarter on television advertising\r\nworldwide."</p><p>The brothers also bankrolled the creation of a new character for\r\nthe mobile age: the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkHm8uUuT0o">Crazy Frog</a>.\r\nRegularly cited as one of the most annoying pop creations in\r\nhistory, the tune sped to number one on singles charts across\r\nEurope and beyond. Jamba! was sold to VeriSign, the\r\nnetwork-infrastructure company, for \xa3176 million in 2004. The sale\r\nwas proof of concept: the Samwers' pragmatic method, an approach\r\nbuilt on the inspiration and innovations of others, was now a\r\ncertifiable business model.</p><p>Over the next few years, the brothers invested in German\r\nversions of YouTube (MyVideo), Twitter (Frazr) and Facebook\r\n(StudiVZ), as well as other technology properties based on US\r\nmodels. Not all were successes, but there were enough to suggest\r\nthe Samwers could take their model one step further. In 2007, they\r\nfounded Rocket Internet, their Berlin-based incubator that's often\r\nderided as a clone factory. Oliver prefers to think of it as "the\r\nUnited Nations of entrepreneurs". On its website, Rocket states\r\nthat it supports companies in more than 20 countries. "Fail fast"\r\nmight be the entrepreneurs' mantra, but at Rocket the wisdom is\r\nslightly different: scale fast.</p>\n<div class="sharePanel"

In 1998, when the brothers were\r\nliving in San Francisco, Marc was struck by the number of people in\r\nhis office who were using eBay. Following a brainstorming session\r\nduring a Christmas holiday together, the Samwers agreed that eBay\r\nwould make sense in the German marketplace.</p><p>Europe's largest economy had been through a decade of fierce\r\nupheaval following its reunification in 1990, but retail law was\r\nstill focused on preserving social mores rather than promoting\r\ncommerce. Sunday-shopping laws were restrictive, and Germany\r\nboasted Europe's toughest restrictions on retail discounts. Online\r\nauctions would at last offer Germans the chance to feel they were\r\ngetting a deal. The brothers say they sent several emails to eBay\r\nsuggesting that the company establish an online auction platform in\r\nGermany, and that they should be hired to run it. When they didn't\r\nreceive a reply, the brothers returned to Germany and, in January\r\n1999, brought in three friends to develop their own platform.</p><p>A month later they founded Alando \xad-- a German-language online\r\nauction website. Among the first items for sale were their own\r\nchildhood toys: Alex sold his train set, Marc auctioned an old pair\r\nof roller skates and Oliver some coins. The team also created what\r\nit called "category captains" who were each responsible for a\r\nspecific area of the site. "We had one person focusing on stamp\r\ndealers, one person focusing on consumer electronics etc," Oliver\r\nsays. "We took it into our own hands and didn't wait for the market\r\nto be founded."</p><p>Within 100 days of going live, the site was sold to eBay for \xa335\r\nmillion. "Those three months were all about execution," says Niko\r\nWaesche, an entrepreneur who helped set up Alando's technology.\r\n"When it started, there were at least 18 auction sites in Germany\r\n-- we weren't the only ones. [The Samwers] were execution\r\nmotors."</p><p>On September 22, 1999, <em>The New York Times</em> ran a story\r\nabout the Samwer brothers and Alando, detailing how they had\r\ninspired other German startups. The success of the German eBay also\r\nalerted major US tech firms to the potency of the market in\r\nGermany. Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman recalled in her autobiography:\r\n"When we started eBay Germany, it took off like an absolute rocket\u2026\r\nGermany was the fastest growing of all eBay sites."</p><p>The Samwers remained at eBay for a year, before leaving to\r\ncreate Jamba!, a mobile-phone-content platform. The brothers again\r\ndemonstrated entrepreneurial flare: when revenues initially didn't\r\nmeet expectations, Oliver decided that rather than pushing\r\nindividual ringtones, the company would create a subscription\r\nmodel. The Samwers also did something else that was unusual for\r\nonline at the time -- they invested heavily in television\r\nadvertising. "Many people think that it doesn't pay back," Marc\r\nSamwer told the <a href="http://www.googlezeitgeist.com/en/">Google\r\nZeitgeist</a> conference in 2007. "We tested it, first with\r\n$10,000, then with $100,000, then with $1 million. In 2005, we\r\nspent $70 million in one quarter on television advertising\r\nworldwide."</p><p>The brothers also bankrolled the creation of a new character for\r\nthe mobile age: the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkHm8uUuT0o">Crazy Frog</a>.\r\nRegularly cited as one of the most annoying pop creations in\r\nhistory, the tune sped to number one on singles charts across\r\nEurope and beyond. Jamba! was sold to VeriSign, the\r\nnetwork-infrastructure company, for \xa3176 million in 2004. The sale\r\nwas proof of concept: the Samwers' pragmatic method, an approach\r\nbuilt on the inspiration and innovations of others, was now a\r\ncertifiable business model.</p><p>Over the next few years, the brothers invested in German\r\nversions of YouTube (MyVideo), Twitter (Frazr) and Facebook\r\n(StudiVZ), as well as other technology properties based on US\r\nmodels. Not all were successes, but there were enough to suggest\r\nthe Samwers could take their model one step further. In 2007, they\r\nfounded Rocket Internet, their Berlin-based incubator that's often\r\nderided as a clone factory. Oliver prefers to think of it as "the\r\nUnited Nations of entrepreneurs". On its website, Rocket states\r\nthat it supports companies in more than 20 countries. "Fail fast"\r\nmight be the entrepreneurs' mantra, but at Rocket the wisdom is\r\nslightly different: scale fast.</p>\n<div class="sharePanel" data-sharify="{&quot;shareImage&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1920x1280/s_v/Samwers.jpg&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory&quot;,&quot;shareText&quot;:&quot;Inside the clone factory: The story of Germany's Samwer brothers&quot;,&quot;shareCount&quot;:true,&quot;platforms&quot;:&quot;Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GooglePlus, Email, WhatsApp&quot;}"></div>\n<div class="articlePaging notLastPage">\n<div class="pagingBar">\n<a href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/page/2">Read page 2</a> <div class="pageNumbering">\n<a class="current" href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory" title="View page 1">1</a><a href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/page/2" title="View page 2">2</a><a href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/page/3" title="View page 3">3</a> </div>\n</div>\n<a class="pagingStyle" href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/viewall">Read on one page</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>, <div id="mainContent">\n<div class="mainCopyEmbedHolder">\n<div class="mainCopy">\n<p><em>This article was taken from the April 2012 issue of Wired\r\nmagazine.

Oliver, 39, is trim and decked out in a fitted\r\nbutton-down shirt, jeans and Gucci sneakers.</p><p>Alexander, 37, is in the office too, wearing a blue Lacoste\r\nshirt. The youngest brother, he holds a master's degree from Oxford\r\nand a Harvard MBA. Marc, 41, who has a reputation for being the\r\nmost charismatic of the three, is currently busy with his duties at\r\nGroupon.</p><p>Alexander is cordial, but the job of talking on the record goes\r\nto Oliver. "We are builders of companies, we are not innovators,"\r\nhe tells Wired. "Someone else is the architect and we are the\r\nbuilders."</p><p>Oliver takes issue with the prevailing notion that he and his\r\nbrothers are driven purely by money. "If I was motivated by money\r\nalone, I would have stopped a long time ago," he insists. Rather,\r\nhe suggests that what galvanises them is winning: "To prove over\r\nand over again that we're the best," he explains.</p><p>In an industry that celebrates innovation, the Samwers are not\r\noriginators, but they are extremely effective in their chosen\r\nfield: they see concepts that are working in the US or Asia and\r\nreplicate the approach for new markets with high barriers of entry.\r\nTheir "clones" can be found in populous, non-English-speaking\r\ncountries including Germany, China, Russia and Brazil.</p><p>"It's become a joke: 'You'd better watch your back or the\r\nGermans will kill you,'" says San Francisco-based Lo\xefc Le Meur, who\r\nruns LeWeb. Le Meur says that he has no desire to trash the\r\nSamwers, whom he considers to be friends; but he does worry that\r\ntheir success has helped to encourage other copycats. "It's making\r\na lot of money for the Samwers, but it's killing innovation in\r\nEurope. It's telling young entrepreneurs that the ideal way to make\r\nmoney is by copying something that works in the US, then selling it\r\nback to the original."</p><p>***</p><p>Serial entrepreneur <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-insider/2011/fail-talk">Stefan\r\nGlaenzer</a> made a similar point in an op-ed for the Frankfurter\r\nAllgemeine in 2010. He speculated that Berlin's Mitte district had\r\nbecome the global centre for cloning digital businesses, and called\r\non investors and entrepreneurs to summon "the courage to think big\r\nand try to improve the world rather than chase the fast buck".</p><p>Shortly after he wrote this, two entrepreneurs who had\r\npreviously worked for the Samwers came to Glaenzer with the idea\r\nfor DailyDeal, a Groupon clone. "When [Fabian and Ferry Heilemann]\r\ntold me about Groupon's business model, I was amazed by its\r\nbeauty," he says. He softened his stance to invest.</p><p>"I said, even though I wrote a huge article two months before\r\nabout how much I hated copying, I would actually engage with the\r\ncopying," says Glaenzer. He cofounded Rebate Networks with StudiVZ\r\ncofounder Michael Brehm to export the model to eastern Europe,\r\nsouth-east Asia and China. "From a business point of view, it's the\r\nfastest-growing business ever," Glaenzer says. DailyDeal was\r\nacquired by <a href="/topics/google">Google</a> in September 2011\r\nfor a sum rumoured to be between \xa398 million and \xa3130 million.

Oliver, 39, is trim and decked out in a fitted\r\nbutton-down shirt, jeans and Gucci sneakers.</p><p>Alexander, 37, is in the office too, wearing a blue Lacoste\r\nshirt. The youngest brother, he holds a master's degree from Oxford\r\nand a Harvard MBA. Marc, 41, who has a reputation for being the\r\nmost charismatic of the three, is currently busy with his duties at\r\nGroupon.</p><p>Alexander is cordial, but the job of talking on the record goes\r\nto Oliver. "We are builders of companies, we are not innovators,"\r\nhe tells Wired. "Someone else is the architect and we are the\r\nbuilders."</p><p>Oliver takes issue with the prevailing notion that he and his\r\nbrothers are driven purely by money. "If I was motivated by money\r\nalone, I would have stopped a long time ago," he insists. Rather,\r\nhe suggests that what galvanises them is winning: "To prove over\r\nand over again that we're the best," he explains.</p><p>In an industry that celebrates innovation, the Samwers are not\r\noriginators, but they are extremely effective in their chosen\r\nfield: they see concepts that are working in the US or Asia and\r\nreplicate the approach for new markets with high barriers of entry.\r\nTheir "clones" can be found in populous, non-English-speaking\r\ncountries including Germany, China, Russia and Brazil.</p><p>"It's become a joke: 'You'd better watch your back or the\r\nGermans will kill you,'" says San Francisco-based Lo\xefc Le Meur, who\r\nruns LeWeb. Le Meur says that he has no desire to trash the\r\nSamwers, whom he considers to be friends; but he does worry that\r\ntheir success has helped to encourage other copycats. "It's making\r\na lot of money for the Samwers, but it's killing innovation in\r\nEurope. It's telling young entrepreneurs that the ideal way to make\r\nmoney is by copying something that works in the US, then selling it\r\nback to the original."</p><p>***</p><p>Serial entrepreneur <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-insider/2011/fail-talk">Stefan\r\nGlaenzer</a> made a similar point in an op-ed for the Frankfurter\r\nAllgemeine in 2010. He speculated that Berlin's Mitte district had\r\nbecome the global centre for cloning digital businesses, and called\r\non investors and entrepreneurs to summon "the courage to think big\r\nand try to improve the world rather than chase the fast buck".</p><p>Shortly after he wrote this, two entrepreneurs who had\r\npreviously worked for the Samwers came to Glaenzer with the idea\r\nfor DailyDeal, a Groupon clone. "When [Fabian and Ferry Heilemann]\r\ntold me about Groupon's business model, I was amazed by its\r\nbeauty," he says. He softened his stance to invest.</p><p>"I said, even though I wrote a huge article two months before\r\nabout how much I hated copying, I would actually engage with the\r\ncopying," says Glaenzer. He cofounded Rebate Networks with StudiVZ\r\ncofounder Michael Brehm to export the model to eastern Europe,\r\nsouth-east Asia and China. "From a business point of view, it's the\r\nfastest-growing business ever," Glaenzer says. DailyDeal was\r\nacquired by <a href="/topics/google">Google</a> in September 2011\r\nfor a sum rumoured to be between \xa398 million and \xa3130 million. It\r\nseems that even the doubters can be persuaded of the benefits of\r\ncloning.</p><div class="incontentAd cnGptAlign_HorizontalCentered cnGptNotFullWidthSlot cnGptSlotOuter" id="article-bottom_GptOuter"><div class="cnGptSlotInner" id="article-bottom"><script>GptAdSlots.register('article-bottom', '/5574/uk.n5574.wired/magazine', {"delaySlot":false,"deleteSlotIfEmpty":true,"sizes":"420x160,300x250,300x600,300x251","containerMinWidthToSizeMap":null,"viewportMinWidthToSizeMap":null,"beforeAdLoadingCallback":null,"onRenderEndedCallback":null,"onJumpinessMinimisedRenderEndedCallback":null,"onSizeChangedCallback":null,"keyValues":{"ismobile":["true"],"istablet":["false"],"pukwrd":["magazine/readmag"],"doctype":["Article"],"nodeid":["15807"],"tag_KeywordTags":["Magazine features","Samwer brothers","Marc","Oliver","Alexander","Samwer","Rocket Internet","Groupon","eBay","Airbnb","Pinterest","Stefan Glaenzer"],"position":["article-bottom"]},"minimiseJumpiness":false});</script></div></div><p>The model that proved so effective for the Samwers came about,\r\nif not by accident, at least partly as a result of eBay's\r\ninattentiveness in its early days. In 1998, when the brothers were\r\nliving in San Francisco, Marc was struck by the number of people in\r\nhis office who were using eBay. Following a brainstorming session\r\nduring a Christmas holiday together, the Samwers agreed that eBay\r\nwould make sense in the German marketplace.</p><p>Europe's largest economy had been through a decade of fierce\r\nupheaval following its reunification in 1990, but retail law was\r\nstill focused on preserving social mores rather than promoting\r\ncommerce. Sunday-shopping laws were restrictive, and Germany\r\nboasted Europe's toughest restrictions on retail discounts. Online\r\nauctions would at last offer Germans the chance to feel they were\r\ngetting a deal. The brothers say they sent several emails to eBay\r\nsuggesting that the company establish an online auction platform in\r\nGermany, and that they should be hired to run it. When they didn't\r\nreceive a reply, the brothers returned to Germany and, in January\r\n1999, brought in three friends to develop their own platform.</p><p>A month later they founded Alando \xad-- a German-language online\r\nauction website. Among the first items for sale were their own\r\nchildhood toys: Alex sold his train set, Marc auctioned an old pair\r\nof roller skates and Oliver some coins. The team also created what\r\nit called "category captains" who were each responsible for a\r\nspecific area of the site. "We had one person focusing on stamp\r\ndealers, one person focusing on consumer electronics etc," Oliver\r\nsays. "We took it into our own hands and didn't wait for the market\r\nto be founded."</p><p>Within 100 days of going live, the site was sold to eBay for \xa335\r\nmillion. "Those three months were all about execution," says Niko\r\nWaesche, an entrepreneur who helped set up Alando's technology.\r\n"When it started, there were at least 18 auction sites in Germany\r\n-- we weren't the only ones. [The Samwers] were execution\r\nmotors."</p><p>On September 22, 1999, <em>The New York Times</em> ran a story\r\nabout the Samwer brothers and Alando, detailing how they had\r\ninspired other German startups. The success of the German eBay also\r\nalerted major US tech firms to the potency of the market in\r\nGermany. Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman recalled in her autobiography:\r\n"When we started eBay Germany, it took off like an absolute rocket\u2026\r\nGermany was the fastest growing of all eBay sites."</p><p>The Samwers remained at eBay for a year, before leaving to\r\ncreate Jamba!, a mobile-phone-content platform. The brothers again\r\ndemonstrated entrepreneurial flare: when revenues initially didn't\r\nmeet expectations, Oliver decided that rather than pushing\r\nindividual ringtones, the company would create a subscription\r\nmodel. The Samwers also did something else that was unusual for\r\nonline at the time -- they invested heavily in television\r\nadvertising. "Many people think that it doesn't pay back," Marc\r\nSamwer told the <a href="http://www.googlezeitgeist.com/en/">Google\r\nZeitgeist</a> conference in 2007. "We tested it, first with\r\n$10,000, then with $100,000, then with $1 million. In 2005, we\r\nspent $70 million in one quarter on television advertising\r\nworldwide."</p><p>The brothers also bankrolled the creation of a new character for\r\nthe mobile age: the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkHm8uUuT0o">Crazy Frog</a>.\r\nRegularly cited as one of the most annoying pop creations in\r\nhistory, the tune sped to number one on singles charts across\r\nEurope and beyond. Jamba! was sold to VeriSign, the\r\nnetwork-infrastructure company, for \xa3176 million in 2004. The sale\r\nwas proof of concept: the Samwers' pragmatic method, an approach\r\nbuilt on the inspiration and innovations of others, was now a\r\ncertifiable business model.</p><p>Over the next few years, the brothers invested in German\r\nversions of YouTube (MyVideo), Twitter (Frazr) and Facebook\r\n(StudiVZ), as well as other technology properties based on US\r\nmodels. Not all were successes, but there were enough to suggest\r\nthe Samwers could take their model one step further. In 2007, they\r\nfounded Rocket Internet, their Berlin-based incubator that's often\r\nderided as a clone factory. Oliver prefers to think of it as "the\r\nUnited Nations of entrepreneurs". On its website, Rocket states\r\nthat it supports companies in more than 20 countries. "Fail fast"\r\nmight be the entrepreneurs' mantra, but at Rocket the wisdom is\r\nslightly different: scale fast.</p>\n<div class="sharePanel" data-sharify="{&quot;shareImage&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1920x1280/s_v/Samwers.jpg&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory&quot;,&quot;shareText&quot;:&quot;Inside the clone factory: The story of Germany's Samwer brothers&quot;,&quot;shareCount&quot;:true,&quot;platforms&quot;:&quot;Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GooglePlus, Email, WhatsApp&quot;}"></div>\n<div class="articlePaging notLastPage">\n<div class="pagingBar">\n<a href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/page/2">Read page 2</a> <div class="pageNumbering">\n<a class="current" href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory" title="View page 1">1</a><a href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/page/2" title="View page 2">2</a><a href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/page/3" title="View page 3">3</a> </div>\n</div>\n<a class="pagingStyle" href="/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory/viewall">Read on one page</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>, <div class="mainCopy">\n<p><em>This article was taken from the April 2012 issue of Wired\r\nmagazine.
